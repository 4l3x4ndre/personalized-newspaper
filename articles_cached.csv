"Genetics may help explain Black men’s high prostate cancer risk, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/15/genetics-may-help-explain-black-mens-high-prostate-cancer-risk-say-scientists,"Scientists have discovered genetic mutations that could help explain why Black men are at higher risk of developing prostate cancer than those of other ethnicities. The findings could lead to a test to identify those at greatest risk of developing the disease, enhancing survival rates.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among British men, with about 52,300 new cases and 12,000 deaths recorded in the UK each year. Black men are twice as likely to be diagnosed and 2.5 times more likely to die from the disease compared with white men.

The reason for this disparity is unclear, but differing levels of a protein called the androgen receptor are suspected to be involved. Male hormones such as testosterone bind to it, sending a signal to cancer cells telling them to carry on growing and dividing. Yet while previous studies have suggested Black men have higher levels of androgen receptor, no one has really understood why, until now.

A key problem has been that the genetic databases researchers use to hunt for sequences that could help to explain such differences are largely based on DNA from white men. “There wasn’t really much information on the different frequencies of mutations across populations to explain why Black men are more likely to develop prostate cancer,” said Dr Greg Brooke, a senior lecturer at the University of Essex, who co-led the research.

To overcome this problem, Dr Antonio Marco, also at the University of Essex, developed an approach that searches for differences in the regulatory regions of genes, while taking recently gleaned information about differences in human populations into account.

They used this tool to analyse DNA from more than 75,000 people from diverse populations worldwide, searching for regulatory regions that may explain why Black men produce higher levels of androgen receptor.

The research, which has not yet been published, identified mutations in three regions of DNA that control androgen receptor levels. “These specific changes to the genetic code [mutations] are frequently found in men with African ancestry while they are virtually absent in men of European ancestry,” said Marco.

They also identified hundreds of other mutations that differ across populations and may affect men’s risk of prostate cancer. These discoveries may ultimately lead to a genetic test that could predict which subset of men are most likely to develop the disease. “Such tests could revolutionise the management of this disease in a similar way that mammograms have for breast cancer,” Brooke said.

Dr Naomi Elster, the director of communications at Prostate Cancer Research, which funded the study, said: “For far too long, people have known about the prostate cancer disparity between Black and white men and not done enough about it. This vital research is changing that, giving us some much-needed answers about why Black men are at greater risk.

“We hope it will lead the way to us being able to identify Black individuals who should be tested more regularly and perhaps given different treatments, helping to close the gap in survival.”","['high', 'risk', 'genetics', 'populations', 'genetic', 'levels', 'cancer', 'likely', 'mutations', 'men', 'say', 'mens', 'scientists', 'prostate', 'black', 'help', 'explain']",https://www.theguardian.com,0.7594198605057616
The existence of a new kind of magnetism has been confirmed,https://www.newscientist.com/article/2417255-the-existence-of-a-new-kind-of-magnetism-has-been-confirmed/,"Altermagnets, theorised to exist but never before seen, have been measured for the first time and they could help us make new types of magnetic computers

Altermagnetism works differently from standard magnetism Libor Šmejkal and Anna Birk Hellenes

A new kind of magnetism has been measured for the first time. Altermagnets, which contain a blend of properties from different classes of existing magnets, could be used to make high capacity and fast memory devices or new kinds of magnetic computers.

Until the 20th century, there was thought to be only one kind of permanent magnet, a ferromagnet, the effects of which can be seen in objects with relatively strong external magnetic fields like fridge magnets or compass needles.

These fields are caused by the magnetic spins of the magnets’ electrons lining up in one direction.

But, in the 1930s, French physicist Louis Néel discovered another kind of magnetism, called antiferromagnetism, where the electrons’ spins are alternately up and down. Although antiferromagnets lack the external fields of ferromagnets, they do show interesting internal magnetic properties because of the alternating spins.

Then in 2019, researchers predicted a perplexing electric current in the crystal structure of certain antiferromagnets, called the anomalous Hall effect, which couldn’t be explained by the conventional theory of alternating spins. The current was moving without any external magnetic field.

It seemed, when looking at a crystal in terms of sheets of spins, that a third kind of permanent magnetism might be responsible, which has been called altermagnetism. Altermagnets would look like antiferromagnets, but the sheets of spins would look the same when rotated from any angle. This would explain the Hall effect, but no one had seen the electronic signature of this structure itself, so scientists were unsure whether it was definitely a new kind of magnetism.

Now, Juraj Krempasky at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland, and his colleagues have confirmed the existence of an altermagnet by measuring the electron structure in a crystal, manganese telluride, that was previously thought to be antiferromagnetic.

To do this, they gauged how light bounced off manganese telluride to find the energies and speeds of the electrons inside the crystal. After mapping out these electrons, they were found to almost exactly match the predictions given by simulations for an altermagnetic material.

The electrons seemed to be split into two groups, which allows them more movement inside the crystal and is the source of the unusual altermagnetic properties. “This gave direct evidence that we can talk about altermagnets and that they behave exactly as predicted by theory,” says Krempasky.

This electron grouping seems to come from the atoms of tellurium, which is non-magnetic, in the crystal structure, which separate the magnetic charges of the manganese into their own planes and allow the unusual rotational symmetry.

“It’s really nice verification that these materials do exist,” says Richard Evans at the University of York, UK. As well as the electrons in altermagnets being freer to move than those in antiferromagnets, this new type of magnet also doesn’t have external magnetic fields like in ferromagnets, says Evans, so you can use them to make magnetic devices that don’t interfere with each other.

The property could boost the storage on computer hard drives, because commercial devices contain ferromagnetic material that is so tightly packed that the material’s external magnetic fields start to see interference – altermagnets could be packed more densely.

The magnets could even lead to spintronic computers that use magnetic spin instead of current to perform their measurements and calculations, says Joseph Barker at the University of Leeds, UK, combining memory and computer chips into one device. “It maybe gives more hope to the idea that we could make spintronic devices become a reality,” says Barker.

Drug offers ‘wonderful’ breakthrough in treatment of asbestos-linked cancer,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/15/drug-offers-wonderful-breakthrough-in-treatment-of-asbestos-linked-cancer,"Scientists have developed a drug to treat mesothelioma, a notoriously hard-to-treat cancer linked to asbestos, in the biggest breakthrough in two decades.

Thousands of people are diagnosed with the disease globally every year, which tends to develop in the lungs and is mainly caused by exposure to asbestos at work. It is aggressive and deadly, and has one of the world’s worst cancer survival rates.

Now scientists are hailing the “truly wonderful” arrival of a new therapy, which they say should offer fresh hope to those with the disease and their families.

In an international trial spanning five countries, led by Queen Mary University of London, a new drug that cuts off the tumour’s food supply quadrupled three-year survival rates. The results were published in the journal JAMA Oncology.

“This trial has changed the lives of people with mesothelioma, allowing us to live longer,” said one of the patients who benefited from the drug. The 80-year-old, who wished to remain anonymous, won compensation from his former employer after being exposed to asbestos in a factory in the 1970s.

He was given four months to live, but thanks to the trial is still alive five years later. “I have five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren now – I wouldn’t want to miss all that,” he said.

The breakthrough is significant, experts say, because mesothelioma has one of the lowest survival rates of any cancer. The new drug, ADI-PEG20 (pegargiminase), is the first of its kind to be successfully combined with chemotherapy in 20 years.

The trial involved patients from the UK, US, Australia, Italy and Taiwan, and was led by Prof Peter Szlosarek at Queen Mary. Each received chemotherapy every three weeks for up to six cycles. Half were also given injections of new drug, while the other half received a placebo for two years.

Among the patients included in the final analysis were 249 people with pleural mesothelioma – when the disease affects the lining of the lungs. They had an average age of 70.

The study, known as the ATOMIC-meso trial, was conducted at 43 centres in the five countries between 2017 and 2021. Those who received pegargiminase and chemotherapy survived for an average of 9.3 months, compared with 7.7 months for those who had the placebo and chemotherapy, according to the results published in JAMA Oncology.

The average “progression-free survival” was 6.2 months with pegargiminase-chemotherapy, compared with 5.6 months among patients who had the placebo and chemotherapy.

“In this pivotal, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial in 249 patients with pleural mesothelioma, pegargiminase-chemotherapy increased significantly the median overall survival by 1.6 months and quadrupled the survival at 36 months compared to placebo-chemotherapy,” the authors wrote.

“Pegargiminase-based chemotherapy was well tolerated with no new safety signals.”

The breakthrough follows two decades of work by Szlosarek, after his original discovery that mesothelioma cells lack a protein called ASS1, which enables cells to manufacture the amino acid arginine.

This knowledge was used to develop the drug. ADI-PEG20 works by depleting arginine levels in the bloodstream. For tumour cells that cannot manufacture their own arginine, this means their growth is thwarted.

“It’s truly wonderful to see the research into the arginine starvation of cancer cells come to fruition,” said Szlosarek. “This discovery is something I have been driving from its earliest stages in the lab, with a new treatment, ADI-PEG20, now improving patient lives affected by mesothelioma.”

Dr Tayyaba Jiwani of Cancer Research UK, which funded the research alongside the biotechnology company Polaris Group, said: “This study shows the power of discovery research which allows us to dig deep into the biology of mesothelioma to uncover vulnerabilities that we can now target with ADI-PEG20.”

Liz Darlison, chief executive of the charity Mesothelioma UK, said: “The UK mesothelioma community, including doctors, nurses, patients and families living with mesothelioma, are extremely proud of ATOMIC. It offers another much-needed treatment option and, above all, hope to those living with mesothelioma.

“We look forward to seeing this treatment become available as a standard option to all patients in the future.”","['mesothelioma', 'wonderful', 'survival', 'months', 'patients', 'chemotherapy', 'cancer', 'uk', 'treatment', 'offers', 'asbestoslinked', 'research', 'trial', 'drug', 'breakthrough']",https://www.theguardian.com,0.7257103424894233
Why does Apple make it so hard to share the Vision Pro?,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24058318/apple-vision-pro-sharing-difficulties,"Shortly before The Verge published its review of the Apple Vision Pro, I put it on to sit for some photos. The review unit had been fitted for our editor-in-chief Nilay Patel, but I’d worn it a few times as a guest and had a surprisingly good experience. That afternoon, though, I foolishly decided to skip the typical guest setup, which involves about a minute of calibration for the Vision Pro’s eye-tracking cameras. I put the thing on, and it didn’t work at all.

The Vision Pro’s cameras, I quickly realized, were expecting somebody else’s eyes. The cursor darted around wildly or refused to move. It wasn’t an unexpected outcome, but it drove home an inconvenient fact: not only would I need to go through the setup again, I’d need to do it every time I wanted to use the headset.

As The Verge has covered the Vision Pro’s release, we’ve run into multiple ways that Apple hamstrings device sharing, from not supporting multiple accounts to making the process of buying extra parts a pain. This isn’t just a computer you use alone, it’s apparently one you own alone — for reasons that seem unnecessary at best and user-unfriendly at worst.

Despite its solitary reputation, the Vision Pro has obvious multiuser appeal

To set the stage here, I want to make a slightly counterintuitive claim: the Vision Pro, despite its solitary reputation, feels built for sharing. In its bulky, expensive first-generation form, it isn’t something most people will want to wear or carry around all day. Its clearest use is either as a special-purpose tool for tasks like 3D design, or as a personal entertainment device, like a virtual TV set-top box or game console. These are exactly the kinds of products that might often be used by one person at a time, but tend to be owned across a household — or workplace — and frequently passed around.

The Vision Pro’s hardware facilitates this surprisingly well. Unlike some VR headsets, the device’s Solo Knit Band is adjusted with a single simple-to-use dial; there’s no need to change the sizing by readjusting awkward velcro straps. Changing the bands is also easy, if needed. It requires a light seal that’s fitted to your face — and there are a whopping 17 possible sizes — but that’s attached with a simple-to-swap magnetic snap. There’s even a simple biometric login option: the face-tracking cameras mounted inside.

It’s easy to imagine a world where this translates into making the Vision Pro more valuable as a multiuser device. Like a lot of people, I tend to share electronics — my criteria for a good entertainment device include whether my husband will use it, too. I don’t see myself wearing the Vision Pro all day for work, but I could imagine putting one on for a couple of hours to play VR / AR games, then handing it off so he can watch TV on a virtual big screen after I fall asleep. Yet the Vision Pro feels designed to undermine that fantasy at every turn.

The most obvious problem is the lack of multiple accounts or profiles. The Vision Pro allows precisely one person to have a permanent account tied to their Apple ID. That’s similar to the iPad and iPhone, but unlike nearly every other computing device in my household, from my Android phone to my MacBook to my husband’s humble Nintendo Switch. Even the Meta Quest system, which tied hardware to personal Facebook or Meta logins a few years ago, lets you swap between up to four accounts!

On the iPhone, the single-user setup is annoying for privacy and customization reasons, but makes a good deal of sense. The lack of multiple user support on the iPad makes far less sense — we have complained about it for years — but at least some iPads are relatively inexpensive.

This headset is $3,499 and only one person in a household can use it fully

The Vision Pro is $3,499 and only one person in your household can ever use it fully, which makes no sense at all. The privacy issues are technically there on the Vision Pro — letting anyone else use it without setting restrictions in guest mode grants them access to everything you’ve got on the headset, including your messages. But as my experience demonstrates, they may not even be able to use it well enough to get that far. You can start a guest session by holding the Vision Pro’s left-side hardware button for four seconds, but you can’t store a second user’s information so they can log in quickly next time without calibration. Basically, imagine if every time you passed an iPad to somebody else in your family, they had to spend a minute poking colored dots.

Then there’s the matter of getting an extra light seal. As I mentioned, I felt fine using a Vision Pro not fitted for me, but others have had problems. Verge product manager Parker Ortolani, for instance, found the Vision Pro with Nilay’s seal size too small and said it leaked light into his eyes. An extra seal costs $199, and you can only buy it one of two ways: ordering online and scanning your face with a Face ID-equipped iOS device, or going in person to an Apple Store and getting a scan done there. Verge video director Owen Grove tried the latter, and his experience wasn’t great.

“I needed to set up an appointment for [a] demo I didn’t want to just buy an extra light seal,” Owen told me. He’d called beforehand to confirm the seals’ availability, only to discover after the half-hour demo that most were sold out, including his size, which the store told him to buy online instead. In general, not being able to simply buy a few different sizes and figure out what works best is inherently limiting for a single user — and makes it almost impossible to share with a few people in a family or workplace.

Things get even more complicated if one or more potential users wears glasses, although this feels like more of an inherent inconvenience than a deliberate roadblock. The Vision Pro uses Zeiss-made prescription lens inserts, which require initial pairing with a passcode stored in Apple’s Health app or a physical card. On the bright side, the interface lets you store multiple lens pairings, so it doesn’t seem like you have to do this every time.

Some of these annoyances might get ironed out over time, as Apple has removed other awkward Vision Pro design quirks with software updates. The company is clearly trying to familiarize people with a new class of computer, and right now that means controlling the experience as closely as possible. If the Vision Pro sees any level of success, things like the demo requirement could fade away. Apple may roll out more options specifically for business or education customers, too, like the Shared iPad feature that allows for some multiuser support.","['does', 'multiple', 'store', 'hard', 'vision', 'device', 'seal', 'share', 'pro', 'pros', 'person', 'apple', 'verge']",https://www.theverge.com,0.7039641773974289
Genetics journal retracts 18 papers from China due to human rights concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/15/china-retracts-papers-molecular-genetics-genomic-medicine,"A genetics journal from a leading scientific publisher has retracted 18 papers from China, in what is thought to be the biggest mass retraction of academic research due to concerns about human rights.

The articles were published in Molecular Genetics & Genomic Medicine (MGGM), a genetics journal published by the US academic publishing company Wiley. The papers were retracted this week after an agreement between the journal’s editor in chief, Suzanne Hart, and the publishing company. In a review process that took over two years, investigators found “inconsistencies” between the research and the consent documentation provided by researchers.

The papers by different scientists are all based on research that draws on DNA samples collected from populations in China. In several cases, the researchers used samples from populations deemed by experts and human rights campaigners to be vulnerable to exploitation and oppression in China, leading to concerns that they would not be able to freely consent to such samples being taken.

Several of the researchers are associated with public security authorities in China, a fact that “voids any notion of free informed consent”, said Yves Moreau, a professor of engineering at the University of Leuven, in Belgium, who focuses on DNA analysis. Moreau first raised concerns about the papers with Hart, MGGM’s editor-in-chief, in March 2021.

One retracted paper studies the DNA of Tibetans in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, using blood samples collected from 120 individuals. The article stated that “all individuals provided written informed consent” and that work was approved by the Fudan University ethics committee.

But the retraction notice published on Monday stated that an ethical review “uncovered inconsistencies between the consent documentation and the research reported; the documentation was not sufficiently detailed to resolve the concerns raised”.

Xie Jianhui, the corresponding author on the study, is from the department of forensic medicine at Fudan University in Shanghai. Xie did not respond to a request for comment, but the retraction notice states that Xie and his co-authors did not agree with the retraction.

Several of Xie’s co-authors are affiliated with the public security authorities in China, including the Tibetan public security authorities. Tibet is considered to be one of the most closely surveilled and tightly monitored regions in China. In Human Rights Watch’s most recent annual report, the campaign group said that the authorities “enforce severe restrictions on freedoms of religion, expression, movement, and assembly”.

Another of the retracted studies used blood samples from 340 Uyghur individuals in Kashgar, a city in Xinjiang, to study the genetic links between them and Uyghurs from other regions. The scientists said the data would be a resource for “forensic DNA and population genetics”.

The retracted papers were all published between 2019 and 2021. In 2021, after Moreau raised concerns about the papers in MGGM, eight of the journal’s 25 editors resigned. The journal’s editor in chief, Hart, has remained in her post. Hart and MGGM did not respond to a request for comment.

MGGM is considered by some to be a mid-ranking genetics publication. It has an impact factor of 2.473, which puts it roughly in the top 40% of journals. It is considered to be a relatively easy forum for publication, which may have been a draw for Chinese researchers looking to publish in English-language journals, said David Curtis, a professor of genetics at University College London. Curtis resigned from his position as editor-in-chief of Annals of Human Genetics, another Wiley journal, after the publisher vetoed a call to consider boycotting Chinese science because of ethical concerns, including those relating to DNA collection.

MGGM states that its scope is human, molecular and medical genetics. It primarily publishes studies on the medical applications of genetics, such as a recent paper on genetic disorders linked to hearing loss. The sudden pivot towards publishing forensic genetics research from China came as other forensic genetics journals started facing more scrutiny for publishing research based on DNA samples from vulnerable minorities in China, said Moreau. He argues that may have pushed more controversial research towards mid-ranking journals such as MGGM that do not specialise in forensic genetics.

On its information page, MGGM states that it “does not consider studies involving forensic genetic analysis”. That caveat was added in 2023, after an editorial review of the journal’s aims.

In recent years there has been a growing scrutiny on research that uses DNA or other biometric data from individuals in China, particularly those from vulnerable populations. In 2023, Elsevier, a Dutch academic publisher, retracted an article based on blood and saliva samples from Uyghur and Kazakh people living in Xinjiang, a region in north-west China where there are also widespread reports of human rights abuses.

The Wiley retractions come days before a Chinese government deadline requiring universities to submit lists of all academic articles retracted in the past three years. According to an analysis by Nature, nearly 14,000 retraction notices were published last year, of which three-quarters involved a Chinese co-author.

A spokesperson for Wiley said: “We are continuing to learn from this case, and collaboration with international colleagues is valuable in developing our policies.

“Investigations that involve multiple papers, stakeholders and institutions require significant effort, and often involve lag time in coordinating and analysing information across all involved, as well as translation of materials. We recognise that this takes a significant amount of time but always aim to act as swiftly as possible.”

In recent years, China has outstripped the EU and the US in terms of total research output, and the impact of its research is also catching up with output from the US.","['journals', 'genetics', 'papers', 'forensic', 'retracted', 'rights', 'concerns', 'retracts', 'dna', 'research', 'human', 'samples', 'journal', '18', 'china']",https://www.theguardian.com,0.6995516210741359

"Big cats can tell apart known and unknown human voices, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/15/big-cats-can-tell-apart-known-and-unknown-human-voices-study-finds,"From tigers to cheetahs, big cats may seem majestically aloof but researchers have found they can tell apart familiar and unfamiliar human voices, suggesting that even animals that shun group living are far from socially inept.

While cats are often portrayed as somewhat standoffish, researchers have previously found that domesticated felines can tell apart the voice of their owner from that of other humans.

Now researchers have found the pets’ exotic cousins, including tigers, cheetahs and cougars, also have an ear for different tones – at least when living in captivity.

Prof Jennifer Vonk, of Oakland University, in Rochester, Michigan, who co-authored the research, said the findings could reflect the need for such animals in the wild to identify their own cubs and keep tabs on who might be in their neighbourhood. She said the skill could also help them pay attention to alarm calls from other species.

“We shouldn’t just assume that sociality is only about group living and that only group living is important for cognition,” she said.

Writing in the journal PeerJ, Vonk and colleagues report how they studied lions, clouded leopards, snow leopards, servals and other exotic cat species that lived in captive settings such as zoos, sanctuaries and nature preserves.

After an initial pilot study involving seven cats from five species, the team carried out a larger study involving 24 cats of 10 species, 16 of which had been hand-reared by humans and eight reared by their own mother.

Each cat was exposed to audio recordings of three unfamiliar humans speaking the same phrase – “Good morning, how are you doing today?” – followed by a recording of the same phrase in a familiar voice, for example that of the animal’s keeper. A final, fifth recording featured another unfamiliar voice repeating the phrase.

The process was then repeated using recordings from the same people but this time featuring the name of the exotic cat.

The team recorded and analysed the cats’ reactions and behaviours in response to each playback – such as a shift in gaze, head movement, moving towards or away from the sound, or vocalisations such as hisses or growls.

The results reveal that regardless of sex or whether the cats were hand-reared or mother-reared, they responded far more quickly, for longer and with greater intensity to the familiar human voice than to the four unfamiliar voices.

The results held even when lions – the only wild cat known to live in large social groups – were excluded from the analysis. The inclusion or omission of the cats’ names in the phrases made little difference.

“I was surprised the results were as clearcut as they were,” Vonk said.

The team say the results also suggest that the ability to tune into individual human voices is not a result of domestication but simply down to regular exposure to humans, with Vonk positing that similar results would probably be found in cats in the wild – provided they heard the same human voices often enough.

However, the study has limitations, including that the small sample size meant the team could not separate results by species, while all of the cats were housed in captivity, with most reared there.

“I think for the public it’s interesting to think that even non-domestic cats are registering who’s looking after them,” Vonk said. “It suggests that they may not be as aloof and indifferent as they sometimes have the reputation for.”","['voices', 'results', 'tell', 'unknown', 'species', 'finds', 'known', 'cats', 'unfamiliar', 'human', 'apart', 'wild', 'study', 'living', 'voice', 'vonk', 'big', 'team']",https://www.theguardian.com,0.6773395319888657

The first experiment to transmit power to Earth from space could lead to a space-based solar power station within 10 years, according to one of the researchers involved.

Microsoft is slowly building to a future where ‘every screen is an Xbox’,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074166/microsoft-xbox-strategy-multiplatform,"Taken on their own, today’s gaming announcements from Microsoft might not seem all that earth-shattering. A handful of unspecified Xbox games are coming to rival platforms, the subscriber numbers for Game Pass have grown, Diablo IV will lead the rush of Activision Blizzard titles on Game Pass, and more hardware is on the way, including a powerful next-gen console and possibly a handheld. But they all point to a future that Microsoft hasn’t exactly been shy about: making Xbox into more than just a console.

In an internal memo to employees, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer explained the strategy like this:

We have a different vision for the future of gaming. A future where players have a unified experience across devices. A future where players can easily discover a vast array of games with a diverse spectrum of business models. A future where more creators are empowered to realize their creative vision, reach a global audience, unite their communities, and succeed commercially. A future where every screen is an Xbox.

It’s a bold idea, particularly because right now, the word Xbox is synonymous with a console that sits under your TV. So if it’s not a physical machine, what is Xbox?

In an interview with The Verge, Spencer said that “Xbox is our gaming platform and content business.” Notably, he did not use the word “console.” Instead, Xbox is an idea, a platform that spans multiple fronts. It started as a console, and now PC and the cloud are a huge part of the Xbox strategy, as is the subscription service Game Pass. With the addition of Activision Blizzard (and its games like Candy Crush and Call of Duty Mobile), as well as the potential for a Microsoft mobile app store, you can add mobile devices to that, too. One day we might include a handheld to that mix. And following the success of previous multiplatform games, most notably Minecraft, rival platforms like the PS5 and Nintendo Switch are increasingly becoming a part of the overall concept of Xbox.

Microsoft seems to be taking measured steps to get to this future vision. It isn’t all in on any one part of the strategy — it sells hardware along with games and subscriptions, and it’s steadily been opening up where you can play those games and subscriptions. It doesn’t need every Xbox gamer to sign up for Game Pass or buy a console, but having both options, along with all of the other ongoing initiatives like cloud and mobile, creates the crux of what the brand is now and where it’s headed.

“I like the fact that we get a mix of things happening with our business,” Spencer explained. “Our business model is not just about hardware sales, it’s not just about first-party game sales. It’s a diverse business model that leads to the business success that we’re seeing today, which I think is kind of a testament to the path that we’ve been on for the last few years.”

“I’m going to learn about our partnership with other platforms.”

Take launching on other platforms as an example. Microsoft says it’s bringing four existing Xbox games to the PS5 and Switch (it’s not saying which four, but they aren’t too hard to guess), and the company is viewing them as something of a test. “I’m going to learn about our partnership with other platforms,” Spencer said. “I’m going to learn about what happens with our players.” Instead of committing to every big Xbox game also being on other platforms, and the uproar that will inevitably occur if Starfield hits the PS5, the company is testing the waters with a few smaller single-player releases and live-service games that could use a boost in players

If this turns out to be a dead end for the Xbox brand, no real harm. But if titles like Pentiment or Sea of Thieves become multiplatform hits, it’s easy to see the initiative expanding with games from other Xbox studios like Bethesda. “We just want to make sure it’s good for the long-term health of Xbox,” Spencer said.

The question, of course, is whether this is a strategy that will ultimately work, and it’s clearly far too early to tell. What is clear is that something has to change. For years, Microsoft has been in a steady third place compared to its biggest rivals, and both PlayStation and Nintendo have largely stayed firm on the idea of selling consoles with big exclusive games. Sony sees an opportunity in other platforms like the PC, Nintendo is expanding into different forms of entertainment, and both are trying out subscriptions. But right now their core strategies haven’t strayed far from the traditional console business.","['business', 'strategy', 'console', 'games', 'game', 'xbox', 'spencer', 'building', 'screen', 'slowly', 'microsoft', 'platforms', 'future']",https://www.theverge.com,0.6228518802943374
"Our human ancestors often ate each other, and for surprising reasons",https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg26134780-500-our-human-ancestors-often-ate-each-other-and-for-surprising-reasons/,"Fossil evidence shows that humans have been practising cannibalism for a million years. Now, archaeologists are discovering that some of the time they did it to honour their dead

Simon Pemberton

IN GOUGH’S cave in Cheddar Gorge, south-west England, archaeologists have found the remains of at least six individuals. Many of the bones were intentionally broken and the fragments are covered in cut marks, the result of people using stone tools to separate them and remove the flesh. What’s more, 42 per cent of the bone fragments bear human teeth marks. There is little doubt: the people who lived in this cave 14,700 years ago practised cannibalism.

Today, cannibalism is a taboo subject in many societies. We see it as aberrant, as is clear in films such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. We associate it with zombies, psychopaths and serial killers like the fictional Hannibal Lecter. Positive stories of cannibals are few and far between. But perhaps it is time for a rethink because, despite our preconceptions, evidence is accumulating that cannibalism was a common human behaviour.

Our ancestors have been eating each other for a million years or more. In fact, it seems that, down the ages, around a fifth of societies have practised cannibalism. While some of this people-eating may have been done simply to survive, in many cases, the reasons look more complex. In places like Gough’s cave, for example, consuming the bodies of the dead seems to have been part of a funerary ritual. Far from a monstrous affront to nature, cannibalism may be a way of showing respect and love for the dead, say some archaeologists.

Tales of cannibals can be found throughout human history. In Homer’s Odyssey,…","['ancestors', 'reasons', 'cannibalism', 'surprising', 'practised', 'marks', 'goughs', 'ate', 'human', 'cave', 'societies', 'million', 'far', 'fragments']",https://www.newscientist.com,0.6015997445552448

"Juvenile great apes love to tease and annoy their elders, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/14/juvenile-great-apes-love-to-tease-and-annoy-their-elders-study-finds,"Footage of great apes has revealed that humans are not the only ones to endure seemingly endless bouts of teasing dished out by their smaller and weaker young who appear intent on pushing their luck.

Recordings of chimps, orangutans, bonobos and gorillas found the animals to be masters of the dubious art, embarking on an impressive range of playful and occasionally somewhat aggressive acts ranging from the cheeky and plain silly to the fabulously irritating.

From 75 hours of footage taken at San Diego and Leipzig zoos, scientists documented 142 clear instances of great apes teasing their compadres, with most instigated by juveniles aged three to five years old.

The apes poked, prodded and ran away, offered objects and then pulled them back, body-slammed one other, stuck their faces in others’ faces, pulled on wisps of hair – a move particularly common in orangutans whose hair is amply long enough – tugged on body parts, tickled, and dangled things in front of each other.

And that was only for starters. In all, the researchers in Germany and the US counted 18 different varieties of teasing in the footage. More than a fifth employed an element of surprise, with an ape approaching its target from behind or while it was looking the other way.

“We cannot really say why they are doing it, but we can observe that they are doing it,” said Dr Isabelle Laumer at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany. “This playful teasing is provocative, intentional, and typically one-sided. It comes very much from the teaser and it often remains that way throughout the interaction.”

As with all the best teasing, a failure to respond to an unexpected poke, or an ape’s face suddenly looming into view, was met with more of the same, with apes repeating their chosen move in 84% of cases or escalating the situation with more elaborate acts of annoyance.

The study of nine bonobos, four orangutans, four gorillas and 17 chimps was too small to find major differences between the species, but adults and juveniles had different strategies. Poking was the most common form of teasing for both adults and juveniles, but while juveniles engaged in hitting and waving body parts at others, adults were gentler and favoured tickling and stealing.

“What’s interesting is we found similarities with human infant teasing,” said Laumer. “When human infants tease their mother, they tend to look to their mother’s face for a reaction. We see that in these great apes too.”

Human infants engage in playful teasing as early as eight months and before they can produce words. Scientists believe the behaviour may help test social boundaries and strengthen relationships.

Although most juvenile apes targeted adults, they often spared their own parents, according to the study in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. There were exceptions, however: Denny the gorilla teased his parents repeatedly, probably because there were few other gorillas around; and Aisha the orangutan became proficient at swinging a rope into her father’s face while he was minding his own business.

It will take more observation to understand why the animals might tease one another. But with the behaviour evident in our closest primate cousins, teasing and the cognitive skills that underpin it may trace back 13m years to the last common ancestor humans share with modern apes, Laumer said.

“Teasing has been discussed in relation to humour, but it can also contribute to understanding social partners,” said Dr Marina Davila-Ross, who studies the evolution of communication at the University of Portsmouth. “If, for instance, a young ape teases another and the second one does not respond, it tells the first individual how far one can go with the second individual, providing vital information about growing up within a social group and establishing hierarchies.”","['annoy', 'juveniles', 'laumer', 'love', 'teasing', 'finds', 'elders', 'adults', 'tease', 'social', 'playful', 'great', 'study', 'apes', 'hair', 'orangutans', 'juvenile']",https://www.theguardian.com,0.5290091850492302

How much electricity does AI consume?,https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption,"Part of / AI at Work

It’s common knowledge that machine learning consumes a lot of energy. All those AI models powering email summaries, regicidal chatbots, and videos of Homer Simpson singing nu-metal are racking up a hefty server bill measured in megawatts per hour. But no one, it seems — not even the companies behind the tech — can say exactly what the cost is.

Estimates do exist, but experts say those figures are partial and contingent, offering only a glimpse of AI’s total energy usage. This is because machine learning models are incredibly variable, able to be configured in ways that dramatically alter their power consumption. Moreover, the organizations best placed to produce a bill — companies like Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI — simply aren’t sharing the relevant information. (Judy Priest, CTO for cloud operations and innovations at Microsoft said in an e-mail that the company is currently “investing in developing methodologies to quantify the energy use and carbon impact of AI while working on ways to make large systems more efficient, in both training and application.” OpenAI and Meta did not respond to requests for comment.)

One important factor we can identify is the difference between training a model for the first time and deploying it to users. Training, in particular, is extremely energy intensive, consuming much more electricity than traditional data center activities. Training a large language model like GPT-3, for example, is estimated to use just under 1,300 megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity; about as much power as consumed annually by 130 US homes. To put that in context, streaming an hour of Netflix requires around 0.8 kWh (0.0008 MWh) of electricity. That means you’d have to watch 1,625,000 hours to consume the same amount of power it takes to train GPT-3.

But it’s difficult to say how a figure like this applies to current state-of-the-art systems. The energy consumption could be bigger, because AI models have been steadily trending upward in size for years and bigger models require more energy. On the other hand, companies might be using some of the proven methods to make these systems more energy efficient — which would dampen the upward trend of energy costs.

The challenge of making up-to-date estimates, says Sasha Luccioni, a researcher at French-American AI firm Hugging Face, is that companies have become more secretive as AI has become profitable. Go back just a few years and firms like OpenAI would publish details of their training regimes — what hardware and for how long. But the same information simply doesn’t exist for the latest models, like ChatGPT and GPT-4, says Luccioni.

“With ChatGPT we don’t know how big it is, we don’t know how many parameters the underlying model has, we don’t know where it’s running … It could be three raccoons in a trench coat because you just don’t know what’s under the hood.”

“It could be three raccoons in a trench coat because you just don’t know what’s under the hood.”

Luccioni, who’s authored several papers examining AI energy usage, suggests this secrecy is partly due to competition between companies but is also an attempt to divert criticism. Energy use statistics for AI — especially its most frivolous use cases — naturally invite comparisons to the wastefulness of cryptocurrency. “There’s a growing awareness that all this doesn’t come for free,” she says.

Training a model is only part of the picture. After a system is created, it’s rolled out to consumers who use it to generate output, a process known as “inference.” Last December, Luccioni and colleagues from Hugging Face and Carnegie Mellon University published a paper (currently awaiting peer review) that contained the first estimates of inference energy usage of various AI models.

Luccioni and her colleagues ran tests on 88 different models spanning a range of use cases, from answering questions to identifying objects and generating images. In each case, they ran the task 1,000 times and estimated the energy cost. Most tasks they tested use a small amount of energy, like 0.002 kWh to classify written samples and 0.047 kWh to generate text. If we use our hour of Netflix streaming as a comparison, these are equivalent to the energy consumed watching nine seconds or 3.5 minutes, respectively. (Remember: that’s the cost to perform each task 1,000 times.) The figures were notably larger for image-generation models, which used on average 2.907 kWh per 1,000 inferences. As the paper notes, the average smartphone uses 0.012 kWh to charge — so generating one image using AI can use almost as much energy as charging your smartphone.

The emphasis, though, is on “can,” as these figures do not necessarily generalize across all use cases. Luccioni and her colleagues tested ten different systems, from small models producing tiny 64 x 64 pixel pictures to larger ones generating 4K images, and this resulted in a huge spread of values. The researchers also standardized the hardware used in order to better compare different AI models. This doesn’t necessarily reflect real-world deployment, where software and hardware are often optimized for energy efficiency.

“Definitely this is not representative of everyone’s use case, but now at least we have some numbers,” says Luccioni. “I wanted to put a flag in the ground, saying ‘Let’s start from here.’”

“The generative AI revolution comes with a planetary cost that is completely unknown to us.”

The study provides useful relative data, then, though not absolute figures. It shows, for example, that AI models require more power to generate output than they do when classifying input. It also shows that anything involving imagery is more energy intensive than text. Luccioni says that although the contingent nature of this data can be frustrating, this tells a story in itself. “The generative AI revolution comes with a planetary cost that is completely unknown to us and the spread for me is particularly indicative,” she says. “The tl;dr is we just don’t know.”

So trying to nail down the energy cost of generating a single Balenciaga pope is tricky because of the morass of variables. But if we want to better understand the planetary cost, there are other tacks to take. What if, instead of focusing on model inference, we zoom out?

This is the approach of Alex de Vries, a PhD candidate at VU Amsterdam who cut his teeth calculating the energy expenditure of Bitcoin for his blog Digiconomist, and who has used Nvidia GPUs — the gold standard of AI hardware — to estimate the sector’s global energy usage. As de Vries explains in commentary published in Joule last year, Nvidia accounts for roughly 95 percent of sales in the AI market. The company also releases energy specs for its hardware and sales projections.

By combining this data, de Vries calculates that by 2027 the AI sector could consume between 85 to 134 terawatt hours each year. That’s about the same as the annual energy demand of de Vries’ home country, the Netherlands.

“You’re talking about AI electricity consumption potentially being half a percent of global electricity consumption by 2027,” de Vries tells The Verge. “I think that’s a pretty significant number.”

A recent report by the International Energy Agency offered similar estimates, suggesting that electricity usage by data centers will increase significantly in the near future thanks to the demands of AI and cryptocurrency. The agency says current data center energy usage stands at around 460 terawatt hours in 2022 and could increase to between 620 and 1,050 TWh in 2026 — equivalent to the energy demands of Sweden or Germany, respectively.

But de Vries says putting these figures in context is important. He notes that between 2010 and 2018, data center energy usage has been fairly stable, accounting for around 1 to 2 percent of global consumption. (And when we say “data centers” here we mean everything that makes up “the internet”: from the internal servers of corporations to all the apps you can’t use offline on your smartphone.) Demand certainly went up over this period, says de Vries, but the hardware got more efficient, thus offsetting the increase.

His fear is that things might be different for AI precisely because of the trend for companies to simply throw bigger models and more data at any task. “That is a really deadly dynamic for efficiency,” says de Vries. “Because it creates a natural incentive for people to just keep adding more computational resources, and as soon as models or hardware becomes more efficient, people will make those models even bigger than before.”

The question of whether efficiency gains will offset rising demand and usage is impossible to answer. Like Luccioni, de Vries bemoans the lack of available data but says the world can’t just ignore the situation. “It’s been a bit of a hack to work out which direction this is going and it’s certainly not a perfect number,” he says. “But it’s enough foundation to give a bit of a warning.”

Some companies involved in AI claim the technology itself could help with these problems. Priest, speaking for Microsoft, said AI “will be a powerful tool for advancing sustainability solutions,” and emphasized that Microsoft was working to reach “sustainability goals of being carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030.”

But the goals of one company can never encompass the full industry-wide demand. Other approaches may be needed.","['companies', 'cost', 'models', 'usage', 'does', 'hardware', 'data', 'energy', 'consume', 'ai', 'electricity', 'vries', 'luccioni']",https://www.theverge.com,0.46773622547872684
The OnePlus 12R is a $500 phone with flagship tendencies,https://www.theverge.com/24072383/oneplus-12r-review-screen-camera-price,"Choice is a beautiful thing.

The OnePlus 12R has just arrived in the US, and not a moment too soon. It’s the first $500 smartphone we’ve seen in a while that gives the Samsung Galaxy A54 and Google Pixel 7A any serious competition.

Each of these devices is a slightly different answer to the same questions: What’s absolutely essential in a phone? What do you keep when you can’t have it all? Maybe you can’t live without wireless charging, or you want thorough water resistance and a big screen, or you want a high-end processor so the phone feels faster for longer. Guess what? You’ve got choices now! You can afford to be picky with more options on the table.

It all starts with the screen. The OnePlus 12R comes with a 6.78-inch display, bigger than the 6.1-inch Pixel 7A and 6.4-inch Galaxy A54 screens. Resolution is slightly higher than 1080p, which feels like just enough pixels to cover such a massive display. It offers a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz, and it uses a technology called low-temperature polycrystalline oxide, or LTPO, to downshift all the way to 1Hz. Other high refresh rate screens on budget phones shift between a couple of settings, like 60 and 90Hz. LTPO panels are much more common among flagship phones, and they offer a truly variable refresh rate, which saves on battery life.

The screen maximum brightness of 4,500 nits sounds absolutely eye-searing since most phone screens top out between 1,000 and 2,000 nits. And it does get bright in direct sunlight, but because of the way we measure such things, it’s not as fantastically bright as it sounds. In any case, it’s enough to keep the screen comfortable to use outdoors in sunny conditions, which is also rare in a budget phone.

A great screen is one of the OnePlus 12R’s highlights.

I did notice a strange screen flicker on a handful of occasions. It happened maybe once a day, and it’s just a fleeting thing. I asked OnePlus about this behavior, and spokesperson Spenser Blank told me it was the first he’d heard of it. It’s an unusual little bug on an otherwise great display.

Under the hood, the 12R comes with last year’s flagship chipset: the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, along with 8 or 16GB of RAM. The 8 Gen 2 is an absolute unit that powered just about every one of last year’s $1,000 Android flagships, and I had no problem cutting through daily chores and even a few rapid-fire portrait mode photos. Using last year’s chip is a smart move, kind of like buying a high-end coat at an end-of-season sale. It’s not the very latest, but it’s still a damn good coat.

Design and software

The flagship vibes carry through to the overall build. The 12R offers a sturdy aluminum frame in a price range where composite plastic is pretty common. The back panel is glass, and the front panel is Gorilla Glass Victus 2 — all very nice and high end. But here’s the less encouraging news: the 12R comes with an IP64 rating, so while it’s totally dustproof, it’s only resistant to water spray and splashes.

The Pixel 7A and Galaxy A54 both come with IP67 ratings, meaning they’re built to withstand brief water immersion like a brief dip in a puddle or (god forbid) a toilet bowl. The 12R absolutely looks and feels the part of a high-end phone, but under unfortunate circumstances, it might not fare as well as one.

Long live the alert slider

Long live the alert slider: OnePlus’ signature three-stage mute switch is alive and well on the 12R. It’s a handy way to turn your volume on to watch a TikTok and quickly turn it off again, and I appreciate it.

I’m less keen on the phone’s curved edges — sometimes a menu option sort of disappears off the side of the screen, and I feel like I’m tapping on the side of the phone to reach it. Plus, they make the phone feel a little more slippery in your hand. This is personal preference, but flat edges on phones are making a comeback lately, and I’m here for it.

The OnePlus 12R’s curved edges look sleek, but they can be a pain to deal with.

Something else that’s not so nice? No wireless charging. The OnePlus 12R supports very fast wired charging — up to 80W for the US version. Wireless charging isn’t all that common in $500 phones, but the Pixel 7A has it. It’s not a must-have for everyone, but I would personally rather have the flexibility of wireless charging than fast wired charging.

The OnePlus 12R ships with the company’s take on Android 14, OxygenOS 14. It’s straightforward and doesn’t require as much rejiggering as Samsung’s One UI to live with it peacefully. The company says the 12R will get three years of OS upgrades and four years of security support — not a class-leading support policy but enough to last as long as most people will want to hang onto this phone.

Camera and image quality

If you don’t push it too hard, the OnePlus 12R’s camera turns in very nice images. The stabilized 50-megapixel main camera’s standard 1x shooting mode produces nice, detailed images with rich colors. The 2x setting is surprisingly capable considering it’s just digital zoom — not lossless crop zoom.

I used it in dim indoor lighting, and it managed some sharp photos of my kid and his friend preparing to sauté a Beanie Baby on a play kitchen stove. (No Beanie Babies were harmed.) Despite the lighting conditions, the system kept shutter speeds fast enough to freeze the action, which is no small feat for a phone camera.

The 12R gets out over its skis at the 5x zoom setting, though. Even in plentiful outdoor light, photos look like a smeary mess of up-rezzed digital zoom processing. Portrait mode is surprisingly capable, and wisely, OnePlus limits you to the 1x zoom setting here.

There’s a pointless two-megapixel macro camera that I’m convinced OnePlus only included to round out the number of lenses on the rear camera bump. Video recording is just fine for casual clips — 1080/30p is the default, but you can bump that up to 4K/30p without a noticeable crop.

The OnePlus 12R is a sorely needed midrange contender in the US. It’s lacking some features you can find on its peers, like wireless charging and a beefier water resistance rating, but it brings enough to the table that it’s a legitimate alternative to the Pixel and Galaxy options.

You won’t find another screen this big and this nice on a $500 phone sold in the US, for starters. Overall build quality is right up there with the best, even if the curved edges aren’t my favorite. Opting for Qualcomm’s previous-gen flagship chipset is a smart move, too. I like its long-term prospects better than the Tensor and Exynos chips in the competition.

The Pixel 7A is probably still the better choice for photo quality, though I’m impressed with how narrow of a lead it has over the OnePlus. The 12R actually does better than the Pixel in some situations, like at the 2x zoom setting, but ultimately, the 7A offers a more consistent camera experience. On the other hand, the Galaxy A54 is worth considering if you’re after a bigger screen and better water resistance, though it also misses out on wireless charging and lacks some of the 12R’s finesse with its composite frame.

The 12R won’t be the right choice for everyone, but you know what? That’s okay. It doesn’t need to be a one-size-fits-all device because you’ve got other options. And that’s a wonderful thing.
