New York City sues social media platforms over youth mental health crisis,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/14/tech/new-york-city-sues-social-media-platforms-youth-mental-health/index.html,"CNN —

New York City is suing a handful of social media networks, alleging their platforms’ designs exploit young users’ mental health and cost the city $100 million in related health programs and services each year.

In the lawsuit against TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and YouTube, the city of New York said the platforms are responsible for an uptick in mental health issues among young people, including depression and suicide ideation. These issues, the lawsuit states, impose a “large burden on cities, school districts and public hospital systems that provide mental health services to youth.”

The lawsuit comes shortly after executives from social media platforms faced tough questions from lawmakers during the latest congressional hearings over how their platforms may direct younger users – and particularly teenage girls – to harmful content, damaging their mental health and body image.

A growing number of families have sued social media companies, along with US states and municipalities, over the alleged impact on the mental health of their children. But during a press conference on Wednesday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said: “NYC is first major American city to take combined steps of this magnitude and call out the danger of social media clearly and directly just as the surgeon general did with tobacco and guns.”

New York City said it is seeking monetary damages and equitable relief to fund prevention education and mental health treatment.

The city also released a social media action plan that highlights how it plans to hold social media companies accountable, provide education and support to young people and families, and study the long-term impacts of social media on youth.

A Snap spokesperson told CNN the platform was “intentionally designed to be different from traditional social media” with a focus on helping users communicate with close friends and by opening up directly to the camera rather than a feed of content.

“While we will always have more work to do, we feel good about the role Snapchat plays in helping close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence,” the spokesperson said.

Meanwhile, Meta – the parent company of Instagram and Facebook – said it offers more than 30 tools and features to support them and their parents.

“We’ve spent a decade working on these issues and hiring people who have dedicated their careers to keeping young people safe and supported online,” a spokesperson said.

Similarly, a TikTok spokesperson said it supports young users with various tools, such as automatic time limits, and regularly partners with experts to understand emerging best practices.

YouTube parent company Google also said it works with mental health and other experts to give age-appropriate experiences and parental controls. “The allegations in this complaint are simply not true,” said José Castañeda, a Google spokesperson.

Last month, Mayor Adams called social media a “public health hazard” and an “environmental toxin” during his State of the City address. The lawsuit also builds on last year’s Surgeon General warning that declared social media a “profound risk of harm” for kids.

While announcing the action plan, Adams said he’s increasingly concerned about the “dangerous” and “addictive” features that impact the lives of young people.

“Instead of talking to each other over lunch at the cafeteria, they are absorbed in screens,” he said. “Instead of playing at the park with friends, they are inside on a sunny day, clicking and scrolling. Instead of learning confidence and resilience, they’re being exposed to content that often leads to insecurity and depression.”

He said the move to sue these companies is “a bold action on behalf of millions of New Yorkers” to hold these companies accountable for their role in this crisis.

However, in the US, it’s very hard to sue social media platforms because of a 28-year-old federal law called “Section 230,” which holds that tech companies cannot be held liable for the content that users post to their platforms.

By contrast, under the EU’s Digital Service Act, companies can be sued for up to 6% of their worldwide revenues if they violate the law.

Why does Apple make it so hard to share the Vision Pro?,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24058318/apple-vision-pro-sharing-difficulties,"Shortly before The Verge published its review of the Apple Vision Pro, I put it on to sit for some photos. The review unit had been fitted for our editor-in-chief Nilay Patel, but I’d worn it a few times as a guest and had a surprisingly good experience. That afternoon, though, I foolishly decided to skip the typical guest setup, which involves about a minute of calibration for the Vision Pro’s eye-tracking cameras. I put the thing on, and it didn’t work at all.

The Vision Pro’s cameras, I quickly realized, were expecting somebody else’s eyes. The cursor darted around wildly or refused to move. It wasn’t an unexpected outcome, but it drove home an inconvenient fact: not only would I need to go through the setup again, I’d need to do it every time I wanted to use the headset.

As The Verge has covered the Vision Pro’s release, we’ve run into multiple ways that Apple hamstrings device sharing, from not supporting multiple accounts to making the process of buying extra parts a pain. This isn’t just a computer you use alone, it’s apparently one you own alone — for reasons that seem unnecessary at best and user-unfriendly at worst.

Despite its solitary reputation, the Vision Pro has obvious multiuser appeal

To set the stage here, I want to make a slightly counterintuitive claim: the Vision Pro, despite its solitary reputation, feels built for sharing. In its bulky, expensive first-generation form, it isn’t something most people will want to wear or carry around all day. Its clearest use is either as a special-purpose tool for tasks like 3D design, or as a personal entertainment device, like a virtual TV set-top box or game console. These are exactly the kinds of products that might often be used by one person at a time, but tend to be owned across a household — or workplace — and frequently passed around.

The Vision Pro’s hardware facilitates this surprisingly well. Unlike some VR headsets, the device’s Solo Knit Band is adjusted with a single simple-to-use dial; there’s no need to change the sizing by readjusting awkward velcro straps. Changing the bands is also easy, if needed. It requires a light seal that’s fitted to your face — and there are a whopping 17 possible sizes — but that’s attached with a simple-to-swap magnetic snap. There’s even a simple biometric login option: the face-tracking cameras mounted inside.

It’s easy to imagine a world where this translates into making the Vision Pro more valuable as a multiuser device. Like a lot of people, I tend to share electronics — my criteria for a good entertainment device include whether my husband will use it, too. I don’t see myself wearing the Vision Pro all day for work, but I could imagine putting one on for a couple of hours to play VR / AR games, then handing it off so he can watch TV on a virtual big screen after I fall asleep. Yet the Vision Pro feels designed to undermine that fantasy at every turn.

The most obvious problem is the lack of multiple accounts or profiles. The Vision Pro allows precisely one person to have a permanent account tied to their Apple ID. That’s similar to the iPad and iPhone, but unlike nearly every other computing device in my household, from my Android phone to my MacBook to my husband’s humble Nintendo Switch. Even the Meta Quest system, which tied hardware to personal Facebook or Meta logins a few years ago, lets you swap between up to four accounts!

On the iPhone, the single-user setup is annoying for privacy and customization reasons, but makes a good deal of sense. The lack of multiple user support on the iPad makes far less sense — we have complained about it for years — but at least some iPads are relatively inexpensive.

This headset is $3,499 and only one person in a household can use it fully

The Vision Pro is $3,499 and only one person in your household can ever use it fully, which makes no sense at all. The privacy issues are technically there on the Vision Pro — letting anyone else use it without setting restrictions in guest mode grants them access to everything you’ve got on the headset, including your messages. But as my experience demonstrates, they may not even be able to use it well enough to get that far. You can start a guest session by holding the Vision Pro’s left-side hardware button for four seconds, but you can’t store a second user’s information so they can log in quickly next time without calibration. Basically, imagine if every time you passed an iPad to somebody else in your family, they had to spend a minute poking colored dots.

Then there’s the matter of getting an extra light seal. As I mentioned, I felt fine using a Vision Pro not fitted for me, but others have had problems. Verge product manager Parker Ortolani, for instance, found the Vision Pro with Nilay’s seal size too small and said it leaked light into his eyes. An extra seal costs $199, and you can only buy it one of two ways: ordering online and scanning your face with a Face ID-equipped iOS device, or going in person to an Apple Store and getting a scan done there. Verge video director Owen Grove tried the latter, and his experience wasn’t great.

“I needed to set up an appointment for [a] demo I didn’t want to just buy an extra light seal,” Owen told me. He’d called beforehand to confirm the seals’ availability, only to discover after the half-hour demo that most were sold out, including his size, which the store told him to buy online instead. In general, not being able to simply buy a few different sizes and figure out what works best is inherently limiting for a single user — and makes it almost impossible to share with a few people in a family or workplace.

Things get even more complicated if one or more potential users wears glasses, although this feels like more of an inherent inconvenience than a deliberate roadblock. The Vision Pro uses Zeiss-made prescription lens inserts, which require initial pairing with a passcode stored in Apple’s Health app or a physical card. On the bright side, the interface lets you store multiple lens pairings, so it doesn’t seem like you have to do this every time.

Some of these annoyances might get ironed out over time, as Apple has removed other awkward Vision Pro design quirks with software updates. The company is clearly trying to familiarize people with a new class of computer, and right now that means controlling the experience as closely as possible. If the Vision Pro sees any level of success, things like the demo requirement could fade away. Apple may roll out more options specifically for business or education customers, too, like the Shared iPad feature that allows for some multiuser support.","['hard', 'verge', 'person', 'multiple', 'vision', 'device', 'does', 'seal', 'pros', 'store', 'pro', 'apple', 'share']",https://www.theverge.com,0.6861145919642275
Judge Engoron’s ruling: What will it mean for Donald Trump’s businesses?,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/17/economy/donald-trump-trial-ruling-business/index.html,"New York CNN —

A whopping $355 million judgment and other punitive measures in the New York civil fraud trial against former president Donald Trump, his sons and the Trump Organization will deal a very big — but maybe not fatal — blow to their New York State-based businesses.

At least not directly or immediately.

There is still a lot to parse from the ruling and its potential impact on Trump’s business empire, but here’s what we know so far.

Trump and his sons Donald Jr. and Eric will not be allowed to hold officer or director roles at their New York-based businesses for the foreseeable future — Trump for three years, his sons for two. That’s thanks to a ruling Friday from Judge Arthur Engoron in a case brought by New York State Attorney General Letitia James against Trump and his businesses for filing fraudulent financial statements to obtain loans and insurance at favorable rates. Nor will Trump or the Trump Organization be allowed to borrow money from financial institutions chartered or registered in New York State for three years.

“Trump still owns his businesses. But he and his family are really cut off from running and maintaining them,” said Will Thomas, assistant professor of business law at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. “Their avenues for control have shrunk dramatically.”

The ruling on paper, Ross added, “strikes me as a really dramatic lock on his ability to access capital.”

It could have been worse.

They also had been facing the possibility of losing their state business certificates, which would have prevented them from operating their many limited liability corporations in New York. And Trump himself might have been permanently barred from the New York state real estate industry, something James had requested.

“The bottom line is the New York attorney general’s office got the money but not the permanent bans [on the Trump businesses] that they wanted,” said David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of three books on Trump.

Instead, the final ruling calls for the Trump Organization to be run essentially by an independent monitor, who was court appointed in 2022, and a new independent compliance director.

The ruling extended the monitor’s role “for no less than three years.”

That new governance structure is the reason Judge Engoron cited for not cancelling the Trumps’ business certificates. “(A)s going forward there will be two-tiered oversight, (by) an Independent Monitor and an Independent Director of Compliance, of the major activities that could lead to fraud, cancellation of the business licenses is no longer necessary,” he wrote in the ruling.

Trump is expected to appeal the judgment. But the fact that Engoron did not effectively dissolve his businesses and instead called for independent oversight may hurt his chances of winning. “The court’s decision to impose governing requirements [on Trump’s businesses] makes the injunction more likely to survive appeal,” Thomas said.

How the $355 million payment might affect Trump’s businesses

The $355 million that Trump and his companies must pay is a disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from the fraudulent practices for which Engoron found him liable. And coupled with the interest that will be charged retroactively to dates the judge specified in the ruling, the total amount may top $450 million, according to estimates from the NYAG’s office.

Trump is expected to appeal the judgment. He has two avenues to do so. First, at the Appellate Division and then at the New York State Court of Appeals. That will take time and could mean the case won’t be put to bed until 2025 at the earliest.

But he can’t put off paying the $355 million plus interest. It will essentially need to be kept in escrow during the appeals process to ensure the plaintiff gets the money Engoron ordered if his full judgment is upheld.

It’s not clear where it will come from. Trump, who claimed last year to have $400 million in cash, could put it up himself if his assertion is true.

But it’s also the case that he is facing another hefty $83.3 million verdict in the civil trial he rec﻿ently lost to E. Jean Carroll.

So he could seek to borrow money and use a big asset (e.g., one of his buildings) as collateral.

Given that Engoron’s ruling bars him from getting a loan from any financial institution registered in New York — which likely rules out most major international banks with offices in New York, Thomas noted — that may mean he would need to get a personal loan from a non-financial institution or an unregistered financial company.

Or he might need to get help from a very high net worth individual, who also may seek a Trump business asset as collateral to secure the loan.

But lending to Trump carries its own special risks.

“Who would lend to Donald Trump after this ruling and given that he’s got four criminal trials?” asked Johnston.","['million', 'donald', 'trumps', 'independent', 'engorons', 'york', 'business', 'trump', 'ruling', 'state', 'mean', 'engoron', 'judge', 'businesses']",https://edition.cnn.com,0.6376152894494886
A US productivity boom may explain how inflation slowed amid a strong economy,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/17/business/productivity-boom-inflation-economy-strong-soft-landing/index.html,"Washington, DC CNN —

Americans are on the verge of living through a historic economic event: inflation fully returning to normal — after a series of punishing interest rate hikes — without a recession. It’s a scenario that analysts refer to as a “soft landing.”

The substantial progress seen so far may be due to a recent burst of productivity growth.

Last year’s strong US productivity meant that workers raked in strong wage gains without employers having to pass on the buck to consumers, at least to a large degree, since they were producing enough in various industries and services to cover for those higher labor costs.

In economics, the concept of productivity is essentially what the word itself means in everyday speak. If productivity is strong, that means the US economy is doing more with less, or being more productive. Since that was indeed the case last year, it meant that the economy was able to grow at the robust pace it did in 2023 without stoking inflation.

Productivity is measured by dividing all the goods and services produced in the economy by every hour people worked. That rate jumped 2.7% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to Labor Department data, which was above the average increase over the past two decades. After falling sharply in 2022, productivity rebounded mightily the following year.

“Productivity is incredibly important for the broader economic and inflation picture, so the question of if workers are going to be more productive is an important one that central banks are considering,” Lauren Goodwin, economist and chief market strategist at New York Life Investments, told CNN.

What has boosted productivity?

There isn’t one definitive reason why productivity grew robustly last year.

One popular theory is that the proliferation of generative artificial intelligence may have made operations for certain tasks more efficient. Researchers argue that GenAI could be transformative in the world of finance and economics, and perhaps in society more broadly, akin to the widespread adoption of the internet around the turn of the century.

But larger productivity gains due to GenAI may take time to become a reality since workers need to be trained on how to utilize it first and firms have to figure out how to best integrate GenAI into their processes, Mark Zandi, Moody’s Analytics chief economist, told CNN previously.

Another possibility is that companies became more productive last year in anticipation of a recession that never happened, according to economists. The job market last year was robust, but some major companies still cut costs, including through layoffs. For example, Microsoft, Meta, 3M, and Citigroup cut thousands of jobs last year.

“A lot of those companies that laid people off because they were expecting a significant slowdown are now lean and mean,” John Min, chief economist at Monex USA, told CNN. “But the economy did well, so that translated into higher productivity, supporting higher wage growth and fending off inflation from accelerating.”

Last year’s productivity boom could also be a combination of all of the above.

The problem with the data

It’s clear that Federal Reserve officials consider productivity before making policy decisions. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told Bloomberg in an interview last year that “you can’t say anything about wages until you actually know what’s happening with productivity.”

But the economic indicator is difficult to precisely measure in real time, which is why it rarely ever moves financial markets whenever it is released.

It’s also released quarterly, the data are usually subject to heavy revisions and it is tough to accurately measure the productivity of services.

“The US is mostly a services-based economy instead of manufacturing, so if I’m counting the number of widgets being produced per hour, then that can be pretty accurate, but on the service side, it’s really hard to know if the price of a haircut went up because of inflation or because it was a better haircut,” Min said.

With 2023 already in the rear-view mirror, productivity may have played a role in creating a path toward a soft landing.

Still, it may be too soon to know if last year’s productivity burst was truly a transformative shift in the US economy.

“Sometimes at the very end of an economic cycle, productivity can be boosted by cost-saving measures,” Goodwin of New York Life Investments said. “Distortions like reducing worker hours might come out as productivity being really high, but when you look at the broader picture, companies are reducing costs by giving people less hours, effectively paying them less, so it’s not that necessarily something is going a lot better for the economy.”

“However, my expectation is that we will see improvements in productivity as a result of generative tools, contributing to disinflation over a longer time period,” she said.","['economic', 'productivity', 'inflation', 'productive', 'workers', 'know', 'economy', 'explain', 'boom', 'told', 'companies', 'slowed', 'amid', 'strong']",https://edition.cnn.com,0.635849912417482
Leading tech firms pledge to address election risks posed by AI,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/16/tech/tech-firm-ai-election-risks-accord/index.html,"New York CNN —

With more than half of the world’s population poised to vote in elections around the world this year, tech leaders, lawmakers and civil society groups are increasingly concerned that artificial intelligence could cause confusion and chaos for voters. Now, a group of leading tech companies say they are teaming up to address that threat.

More than a dozen tech firms involved in building or using AI technologies pledged on Friday to work together to detect and counter harmful AI content in elections, including deepfakes of political candidates. Signatories include OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, TikTok, Adobe and others.

The agreement, called the “Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections,” includes commitments to collaborate on technology to detect misleading AI-generated content and to be transparent with the public about efforts to address potentially harmful AI content.

“AI didn’t create election deception, but we must ensure it doesn’t help deception flourish,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement at the Munich Security Conference Friday.

Tech companies generally have a less-than-stellar record of self-regulation and enforcing their own policies. But the agreement comes as regulators continue to lag on creating guardrails for rapidly advancing AI technologies.

A new and growing crop of AI tools offers the ability to quickly and easily generate compelling text and realistic images — and, increasingly, video and audio that experts say could be used to spread false information to mislead voters. The announcement of the accord comes after OpenAI on Thursday unveiled a stunningly realistic new AI text-to-video generator tool called Sora.

“My worst fears are that we cause significant — we, the field, the technology, the industry — cause significant harm to the world,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Congress in a May hearing, during which he urged lawmakers to regulate AI.

Some firms had already partnered to develop industry standards for adding metadata to AI-generated images that would allow other companies’ systems to automatically detect that the images were computer-generated.

Friday’s accord takes those cross-industry efforts a step further — signatories pledge to work together on efforts such as finding ways to attach machine-readable signals to pieces of AI-generated content that indicate where they originated and assessing their AI models for their risks of generating deceptive, election-related AI content.

The companies also said they would work together on educational campaigns to teach the public how to “protect themselves from being manipulated or deceived by this content.”

However, some civil society groups worry that the pledge doesn’t go far enough.

“Voluntary promises like the one announced today simply aren’t good enough to meet the global challenges facing democracy,” Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital justice and civil rights at tech and media watchdog Free Press, said in a statement. “Every election cycle, tech companies pledge to a vague set of democratic standards and then fail to fully deliver on these promises. To address the real harms that AI poses in a busy election year … We need robust content moderation that involves human review, labeling and enforcement.”","['leading', 'elections', 'election', 'firms', 'tech', 'address', 'risks', 'content', 'work', 'images', 'ai', 'companies', 'posed', 'pledge', 'openai']",https://edition.cnn.com,0.6335124576523493
You should play Splatoon with your family,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075342/splatoon-3-family-bonding,"Usually my younger siblings wait until I’m done with work — they’re in earlier time zones than I am, so they’re being polite — then the group chat lights up: “Splat.” “Splat.” “Splat.”

This is our shorthand for “It’s time to play Splatoon 3.”

I am not what you would call a gamer, but I did buy a Nintendo Switch in 2020. That’s kind of when this all started. I am the oldest of five, and most of my younger siblings love video games. In the interest of bonding, I started hanging out with them on FaceTime while we played Animal Crossing together. In 2022, one of my brothers got Splatoon 3. Eventually, most of the rest of us did, too. Now four of us (and one of my brothers’ significant others) play Splatoon together.

I am writing this, in part, because my younger siblings have some complaints

Our pandemic family video game hangouts never really ended, so now I am logging serious hours on Splatoon. For the uninitiated, it’s a third-person shooter, but a family-friendly one; the idea is to paint as much space in a map as possible. It seems to be set in a future where mammals generally, including humans, are absent. We play as squid-like Inklings that swim through paint. You can be killed by other players during matches, but then you are simply reincarnated.

I get killed a lot.

My siblings and I are scattered across the US, and we don’t get to spend a ton of time together in person. But since we started splatting together, we’ve been hanging out on FaceTime several times a week. We’ve developed a whole intrafamily lore. I thought about explaining it, and then realized it is completely incomprehensible. Just trust me on this one, it’s very funny.

I am writing this, in part, because my younger siblings have some complaints, and they would like me to abuse my position of power (?) at a website in order to air them out. There are nine items on the list at the moment, but I’m sure they will think of something else to complain about soon.

I will air only one: when we all play, it’s annoying to set up matches together, because teams consist of four people and there are often five of us. So what usually happens is that one of us starts playing. Then, once they’re in a match, they can accept “drop-ins” and so the rest of us all drop in, which means we join in the following match. It would be nice if we could figure out how to do this in a more efficient way, so one of us doesn’t have to play alone while the rest of us wait.

I have never been a video games person per se. Mostly, I play them as a way of hanging out with friends; I played Counter-Strike with friends often enough in college that I didn’t embarrass myself, but I wouldn’t say I was good. When I lived in New York after college, video games were a fun way to hang out with my downstairs neighbor after work. Now, they’re sibling bonding time.","['splatoon', 'rest', 'younger', 'way', 'hanging', 'theyre', 'video', 'family', 'play', 'siblings', 'started']",https://www.theverge.com,0.5224114235170529

meribah knight

Yeah. Right. And so you were — how old were you?

Oh, my god. When Brandon was just seven years old, police showed up at his door to arrest him. Brandon’s offense? Tagging along with his older brothers who’d wrestled in a vacant duplex and left some holes in the drywall. Now police were there to take Brandon and his brothers to the juvenile detention center, jail, basically.

speaker 1 My mom said that they weren’t going to take me in. But they were like, well, he needs to learn his lesson.

meribah knight

Brandon was held in detention overnight and then brought to the juvenile court for his hearing.

speaker 1 They had me in shackles, from our feet to our arms, going into court.

meribah knight

Brandon should have gone home with his mom that day. But when he went before the judge, she sent him back to jail for a week. Brandon’s arrest and detention happened in Rutherford County, Tennessee. And his case wasn’t unique there. For over a decade, the county was arresting and jailing kids for even the most minor offenses.

speaker 2 I didn’t want to go to school. speaker 3 I just ran away. speaker 4 I spray painted a penis on a wall.

meribah knight

It happened so often, to so many kids in Rutherford County, that getting sent to juvenile detention was almost a rite of passage. In many cases, what it also was was illegal. This is the story of how that system came to be, how it came to be normalized, accepted, lauded even. It’s also the story of two insiders who actually did see the problem in Rutherford County.

I printed chocolate on a 3D printer and ate it,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/17/24074150/cocoa-press-3d-printed-chocolate,"I hate to be the bearer of bad-for-the-waistline news, but yes — you can now buy a 3D printer that prints chocolate. The Cocoa Press has been in development for an entire decade. Now, it’s finally here, and I’m pretty sure it’s singlehandedly responsible for one of the pounds I put on over Christmas.

At least it’s not cheap or easy enough to tempt most people yet.

This holiday season, I took delivery of a $3,995 prebuilt printer — you can DIY it for $1,750 or less — and thirty sticks of perfect-fit chocolate with which to fulfill my delicious aims.

I attached the printer’s screen, went through setup, popped a dark chocolate “cocoa core” into a cartridge, added a washable plunger cap, preheated the chocolate for 30 minutes, hit start annnnnd... promptly watched the nozzle attempt to eat its silicone baking mat.

It only happened once!

I’m not sure if it was the Z-height, or that the print head got knocked a little loose in shipping, but after I adjusted both things, I tried again and got this incredible 3D-printed rose:

Enhance. You know you want to.

Just look at that flower. Look at the ridges. All that surface area melting on your tongue? I can attest it was scrumptious, velvety, and delightful. It took nearly an entire stick of chocolate for this one print, yet it was gone like two minutes later.

The single best part about 3D-printing chocolate is the incredible textures you can make. 3D-printed gyroid infill? I can’t get enough. (You can see a few examples of that infill in my video atop this story.)

And yes, the dark chocolate really does taste like dark chocolate, despite using palm oil instead of cocoa butter for its fat, presumably for better flow. My wife’s a stickler for dark chocolate, and while it’s definitely not the best we’ve had, she was satisfied with the quality.

But I can’t say the same for the milk or white chocolate — they’re a bit waxy and reminded me of Candy Melts — and I never had a success quite like that first rose again. Because the worst part about 3D-printing chocolate is controlling the heat.

This screw drive pushes a plunger into slightly molten chocolate to squirt it out. Mine always sounded like it was struggling.

Chocolate is fundamentally finicky to print, and not just in traditional 3D printing ways. Cocoa Press lets you program the heat of its nozzle to a tenth of a degree, because fractions of a degree can be the difference between hot enough that it’s runny or too cold to squirt out of the nozzle to begin with.

In my case, it sometimes took hours for the printer’s 65-gram chocolate syringe to reach a uniform temperature. Cocoa Press founder Ellie Weinstein says this was due to a defect in one of my heaters — and will replace the entire cartridge and heater assembly “for anyone who asks” — but heating can also depend on the chocolate itself. Dark almost worked with Cocoa Press’s preset; milk wasn’t much harder, but white took me the better part of a day, adjusting up and down every half hour to find a temperature that flows.

But even when I got the chocolate flowing nicely, I quickly found out that you can’t print anything too small or too pointy without drastically slowing down your prints. The chocolate needs time to cool and solidify before the nozzle tries to print another warm layer on top.

It’s easy to see the point at which this Sierpinski pyramid started to ooze:

The chocolate Sierpinski pyramid nicely breaks into four smaller pyramids for serving — and one central octahedron for your family to fight over.

And there’s probably no point in printing a single calibration cube at all.

A very lumpy, too-smooth calibration cube. The glossy layers didn’t have enough time too cool.

Optimally, I would have slowed these prints down at certain heights to give them time to cool — but right now that’s a manual task, not something Cocoa Press will automate for you.

Though single small objects aren’t all that advisable, I couldn’t print terribly large ones either, since the 65 grams in a single stick of chocolate isn’t a lot. Weighing in at 59.5 grams, that pyramid is approaching the limit of a single cartridge.

2.10 ounces of chocolate pyramids.

But you can print sheets of small objects, like these Mario stars I made:

Not fond of the top surface textures on these stars, but they sure did taste good.

Or, you can take advantage of vase mode, where a 3D printer prints in a single continuous spiral, to build up something tall yet hollow. The rose is a vase mode print, and so is the bottom part of this mock coffee cup — which I printed in white chocolate for the “cup” and milk chocolate for the “lid” on top!

One of the cups from my video, made of two different kinds of chocolate.

Or, you could theoretically swap in a new cocoa core after the first one runs out for a longer print... but again, it’s not automated. You’d have to program it to stop at the right point, or watch it manually and pause it prematurely when it’s running low. Even then, you’d have to wait for the second cocoa core to preheat before you resume the print.

I tried the swap three times. Once, I missed the timing, and the printer ran out and just kept printing air. Once, it seemed like it was going to print seamlessly, but the print mysteriously failed later. And once, I tried to switch from dark chocolate to white chocolate, but the chocolate seized inside the nozzle and refused to come out.

In practice, I found it far easier to simply print objects that would use up most of a stick in one go, then use the remainder to print a second partial object and just pop that directly into my mouth.

Missed my opportunity to resume this print. Nice simple touchscreen buttons.

Despite my struggles, parts of the Cocoa Press feel pretty well thought out. I was impressed to see the printer is natively supported in the popular PrusaSlicer, that all the surfaces that touch chocolate are easily removable and washable, and that my unit even came with perfect-fit cleaning tools. The touchscreen UI is easy to use, with all sorts of enthusiast 3D printer tweaks available if you know what you’re doing. Andrew Sink at Tom’s Hardware, who knows what he’s doing, had a better time than me.

“You know what you’re doing” probably describes the audience for this printer anyhow, though. I can’t imagine a 3D printing newcomer having the patience to enjoy the Cocoa Press, even if they spent upwards of $3,995 for a prebuilt version and $49 per pack of 10 premade chocolate cores.

But I could definitely see some DIY enthusiasts spending the $1,499 for hardware, printing its plastic parts on their own existing 3D printer, spending the 10-15 hours to build it, and learning to craft their own chocolate cores, too — just because they could.","['3d', 'cocoa', 'nozzle', 'ate', 'printing', 'printed', 'chocolate', 'single', 'printer', 'dark', 'print', 'press']",https://www.theverge.com,0.4977614528848953
Top U.N. Court Declines Request to Halt Israel’s Advance on Rafah,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/02/17/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news,"Image A destroyed residential building in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on Friday. Credit... Hatem Ali/Associated Press

The International Court of Justice has declined to issue new constraints on Israel’s military to prevent it from pushing into the final stretch of Gaza where most civilians are sheltering, reiterating instead its ruling last month directing Israel to take action to prevent any potential acts of genocide by its forces.

It said that a new order was not required, and demanded Israel’s “immediate and effective” compliance with the court’s earlier orders, which include protecting civilians, allowing more humanitarian aid and ensuring that it military’s actions would not lead to genocide.

South Africa asked the court this week to intervene to stop Israel’s planned advance into Rafah, saying that such military action would result in “further large-scale killing, harm and destruction.” The court, the United Nations’ top judicial body, is weighing charges of genocide against Israel brought by South Africa.

Israel’s signaling of its intention to enter Rafah has been nearly universally criticized by allies, international organizations and aid groups, alarmed at the catastrophic humanitarian toll that could arise from active battles in a 25-square-mile area where hundreds of thousands of new arrivals are living in makeshift tent cities. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said that a ground invasion is necessary because Hamas battalions remain in Rafah. Israel has already pummeled the area with recent airstrikes that have killed dozens. In the court’s latest ruling, issued on Friday, it said it recognized the “perilous situation” in Gaza, citing the U.N. secretary general’s remarks that an advance into Rafah “would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences.” The court does not have means of forcing states to act in accordance with its decisions. The trial on the main case concerning whether Israel is committing genocide could take months or years to unfold. South Africa welcomed the court’s ruling, and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office said in a statement that “South Africa will continue to use existing channels such as the United Nations Security Council to ensure full and effective implementation” of the court’s January ruling in the case accusing Israel of committing genocide in the war. In that decision, the court said that Israel must take actions to prevent acts by its forces in Gaza that are banned under the 1948 Genocide Convention. Despite the international warnings, Mr. Netanyahu as recently as Wednesday reaffirmed his intensions for a ground assault. He said it would come after his military has allowed civilians to leave battle zones. “We will fight until complete victory and this includes a powerful action also in Rafah,” he wrote on the social platform X. Some of the civilians sheltering in Rafah, many of whom have moved multiple times as Israeli military actions have pushed farther south, have moved back north toward Deir al Balah, according to the United Nations’ humanitarian coordinator. They are having to relocate while also suffering through acute shortages of food and water. People in Rafah have grown so desperate that they are stopping aid trucks and eating what food they manage to get on the spot, according to the U.N. report. Lynsey Chutel contributed reporting.

Figma’s CEO on moving on after failed Adobe merger,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075126/figma-ceo-dylan-field-interview-after-adobe,"Happy Friday. Earlier this week, I spoke with Figma CEO Dylan Field for his first extended interview since regulators forced Adobe to abandon its $20 billion acquisition of his company — a deal that would have been one of the largest ever for a software company.

You can read the Q&A below, plus my notes on the latest AI news, an exec departure at X, and more…

“It was a huge relief”

Very few people get to sell their startup for billions of dollars. Even fewer have the opportunity taken away.

With his blockbuster sale to Adobe having been blocked by regulators, Figma CEO Dylan Field finds himself in that unique position. It hasn’t been an easy reset, especially for the early Figma employees who believed they were about to get paid out. He recently offered anyone who wanted to leave Figma severance, which 4 percent of employees took him up on. And he has lowered Figma’s internal valuation to $10 billion, the same number it was in 2021.

At the same time, Figma appears to be in a stronger position than when it first agreed to sell to Adobe in September 2022. The business has been cash-flow positive for a while, I’m told, and it finished 2023 with about $600 million in annual recurring revenue — a roughly 40 percent increase from the year before. Its chief rival, InVision, has decided to shut down. And Figma is now flush with even more cash, thanks to Adobe having to pay it a hefty $1 billion breakup fee.

Field tells me he wants to use that money to be the acquirer this time, and that he’s looking at new areas for Figma to expand into after the recent debut of Dev Mode, the company’s first product specifically for software developers. “Figma was never just meant to be a design tool,” he says. He is also, naturally, a big believer in generative AI and the role it will increasingly play in the design process.

“We were really limited by the technology at the time back in 2012, 2013,” he tells me. “And now those limitations have faded away.”

The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity:

The moment you find out the Adobe deal isn’t going to happen, and you have to communicate this to your employees and the world, what goes through your head?

I think that the mental context for me is that regulatory processes are stressful. [Laughs] So, when we finally had the clarity coming out of it after 16 months of not having that clarity, not knowing exactly what the future of Figma was going to be, it was a huge relief.

We had, to the degree we legally could, been updating the team throughout the process as well. And so, honestly, the all-hands [after the deal was called off] felt more like Figma than ever. I was asking people to join me on the first day of [companywide PTO] break, but a ton of the company joined us. It felt lighter. It felt really energized. People were cracking jokes in the chat and, just in general, there’s this feeling of optimism about our future as an independent company.

You could have decided to put the business on autopilot during the deal review process, but you didn’t. You hired over 500 people, held a big conference, and shipped a bunch of stuff.

The New York Times recently had this story where they were saying, after last year’s Config conference, a Figma employee survey “showed a spike in feelings of burnout and of being overwhelmed by deadlines.” I’m wondering where the urgency that the company had during this time came from and how you managed through that? Was there a lot of pressure to essentially prove your worth more because of what was hanging over you?

It’s pretty simple. I just thought through it, and I’m like, “Okay, first of all, you want to maintain the culture we’ve already built,” which is a startup culture, one of urgency, one of running with it and moving quickly and making sure that we get things done. But also, one of the values I mentioned, “run with it,” is this idea of, if you see something that needs to be done and no one’s doing it, pick it up and go.

I think that first of all, maintaining that culture was really important to me. But secondly, whatever happened with the deal, whether we ended up at Adobe or we ended up an independent company, it was super important that we came through this process stronger than ever and were moving quickly and executing and shipping.

The idea behind doing the deal in the first place was this will allow us to accomplish our vision and do things faster than we would otherwise, right? You want to make sure that’s actually true. If you slow down the pace, that wouldn’t be true. And of course, in the case where we’re an independent company, you want to make sure that you do that.

Then, last month, you updated everyone’s comp packages to try to account for the lost value from the deal not happening. You also announced this severance program called Detach for anyone who wanted to leave. What was the goal of doing that?

I want to make sure that people who are at Figma are committed. You can’t blame people who might be tired after many, many years of working at Figma or joined the company thinking it would be Adobe, but then, actually, it’s a startup. Perhaps they didn’t feel that was the right fit for them. That’s okay.

I made it clear to everyone who was considering that they’re still a friend of Figma. You’re welcome to reapply in six months if you want to. But I wanted to make sure that there was clarity on who was in and also the expectations going forward. We’re a startup, and we’ve got a lot to do, a lot to prove.

How many people took that severance offer?

It was about 4 percent of our employees. A little over 50 people.

Did that number surprise you? I’m sure you were hoping for fewer.

Yeah. I told the team that if no one takes this, I’ll be thrilled. I didn’t really know what to expect, to be honest with you. I think that at the end of the day, it was positive that people who did detach and decide to leave, they did it in a way that held a really strong relationship with the company. I think it was a positive way to work through that challenge.

For a lot of people, I’ve had a chance to talk with them and at least say hello and thank them for their work at Figma. I feel really good about the way that was left. We just had our all-hands a few minutes ago. There’s so much excitement in the building.

You got that $1 billion breakup fee from Adobe. What are you going to do with that cash?

Adobe is an amazing company. We were very lucky to get to interact with them through this period. We want to still be an efficient business, so we’re focused on making sure that continues.

I think there is an opportunity now to do more strategic M&A in the future. We’re still thinking through what that could mean. It’s not like we’ve got a solidified point of view on what that means yet. But yeah, it does unlock the opportunity to go make even bigger bets.

As we think about Figma as a company, as a platform, Figma was never just meant to be a design tool. The original founding vision of Figma from the early days was to eliminate the gap between imagination and reality. And at some point, people were like, “Hey, that sounds nice and all, but I don’t really know what that means. Can we make it more clear so we can go hire people? Because we’re telling them this, and their eyes glaze over.” And so we made our North Star to make design accessible to all.

And now we’re in this really interesting moment in time where I feel like those two visions are converging, in particular for the product design process, which is the one that we are most focused on.

There are a lot of opportunities to think about how you cross those abstraction boundaries now in ways that you just couldn’t before without AI. In the early days of Figma, we explored how to make it so that you can manifest those ideas faster. We were really limited by the technology at the time back in 2012, 2013. And now those limitations have faded away.

Do you see Figma moving into more general productivity software? That can be as rudimentary as a notes app, right? What areas are you looking to expand into?

I really think of it as, “Let’s figure out the value chain of what it takes to think about, get buy-in for, design, code, ship, and measure software. How do we complete that value chain?” That could be through partnerships as well. I don’t think that we’re going to go into the note space, for example, just because that’s something that you asked me about. I would love to deepen our partnerships and relationships with companies that are doing that.

Would you partner with Adobe now? What’s your vibe like with the people over there after all of this?

It’s good. I’m a big fan of the folks there. We spent a lot of time with them. It is weird because there’s so much I wanted to learn from them in terms of the way they run their business and have been able to build products at scale and serve their market. A strange dynamic during the process [was that] because, you know, for various and good reasons, there’s only so much you can share between parties. That was the first conversation that started to take place was, “What can we do to partner together?” No plans yet but very eager to explore further there.

Is the future now that Figma becomes a public company? That seems like the natural evolution of all of this, that you tack on some companies to you now and maybe Figma is public in two to three years.

I think there’s so much we can build as well. I don’t want to say that strategic M&A is the only way we can grow. We’ve got no shortage of ideas and adjacencies that we can explore.

But yeah, there are two paths that venture-funded startups go down. You either get acquired or you go public. And we explored thoroughly the acquisition route.

When I was with you recently, you showed some of the generative AI stuff in the product. I think AI may replace some kinds of work but maybe not jobs. How does AI over time replace designers, if at all, or at least very big parts of the design process?

My point of view here is that AI provides an opportunity to lower the floor but raise the ceiling. Make it so that more people can come into the design process. More people can contribute their ideas and transform them into visuals, even if they don’t know all the ins and outs of Figma. We’re very much a company that cares about democratization. So how do you bring more people into that process? There should be ways for AI also to create efficiency so that designers are able to do more with less time. We’re looking into both of those areas right now.

If I was to zoom out even further to knowledge work, we’re very much in a paradigm of AI as a tool and AI helping people get work done, but it’s not necessarily a replacement. I really think that there’s a human in the loop going forward in that AI might be a useful tool, but we all know its limits in terms of hallucinations, in terms of potential inaccuracies. Even if you apply it to rote tasks, it’s important to check the work. And you know better than anyone as a writer that the current models do not match your ability to write, let alone gain context in a conversation to ask the right questions or show the intelligence that you have as a journalist.

If you think about what it takes to create great design, there’s so much in that context window that’s emotional or thinking temporally about a brand experience or a user flow. I just don’t see how, in the near term, AI is able to have that as part of its context, which means that humans are providing that.

Is there a business for you with your user data being valuable for training? I imagine having your own corpus of multimodal data means that you could do something interesting there.

Designers’ data is certainly interesting. But it’s an area that’s still underexplored for us because, in order to do it at scale, we want to do that in collaboration with our user community and do it in a way that aligns with the values of our user community, too. There’s so much you can do by just relying on things like GPT-4. Right now, we’re still in almost low-hanging fruit territory. Of course, there’s an opportunity to think about data and scaling laws over time. I wouldn’t say it’s where we’re at yet.

One last quick question: as CEO, what’s the biggest lesson you will take from the whole Adobe saga?

Keep your foot on the gas.

Notebook

My thoughts on what else is happening in tech right now:

- Sam Altman wants trillions: The reporting that Altman wants to raise trillions of dollars to build AI chips raises so many questions. I know he has been talking to big investors in the Middle East about a “Tigris” chip project for a while now. OpenAI is apparently going to be a customer of this new chip entity, which suggests it will be a separate company. Does Altman, who has also quietly owned OpenAI’s venture fund this whole time, run this new Tigris company and own a chunk of it? How does that affect his role at OpenAI? He is set to appear for a fireside chat with Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger next week in San Jose, CA. Perhaps we’ll learn more then.

- Dueling announcements from Google and OpenAI: I’m sure it was a coincidence that OpenAI previewed its Sora text-to-video model on the same day that Google announced Gemini 1.5. Putting the tech itself aside, Google doesn’t actually have a way for non-enterprise customers to play with the latest Gemini model yet, and Sora is not accessible to the general public either. Both of these stories are clearly about optics and recruiting. In that respect, I have to give this round to Altman for taking requests for Sora videos and posting them live on X. OpenAI has an energy and clarity to how it talks about new products that continues to suck up all the oxygen in the industry.

"Election 2024 As Trump heads to Michigan, the state G.O.P. is in disarray.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/02/17/us/trump-haley-biden-election,"As early in-person voting began on Saturday in Michigan, a fight for control of the G.O.P. in the crucial battleground state plunged Republicans there deeper into a political maelstrom, with rival factions potentially barreling toward hosting dueling nominating conventions.

As if things weren’t already confusing.

In a little over a week, the state will host a traditional primary on one day, and then a caucus-style convention a few days later. Now, it seems, there could actually be two conventions, in different parts of the state, each claiming legitimacy.

Former President Donald J. Trump is headed to Michigan on Saturday night, with a campaign rally in Waterford Township, about 30 miles northwest of Detroit. While he has made it clear which faction he is supporting, and so has the national party, that has done little to dissuade the Trump-styled election denier attempting to hold on to power.

The feud, already being waged in state court, appears to be only gaining intensity.

Pete Hoekstra, whom the Republican National Committee recognized on Wednesday as the state party’s rightful chairman after his election last month, said he was moving forward with plans to hold a statewide nominating convention on March 2 in Western Michigan.

But Kristina Karamo, defying the R.N.C.’s determination that she had properly been removed as party chairwoman earlier in January and Mr. Trump’s endorsement of Mr. Hoekstra, has also indicated that she will continue hosting a convention on the same day, for the same purpose, but in Detroit.

At stake at the convention will be 39 of Michigan’s 55 Republican presidential delegates. The other 16 will be decided during the state’s Feb. 27 primary, which includes at least nine days of early voting. The hybrid process, new this year, was adopted by Republicans in order to comply with R.N.C. rules after Michigan’s Democratic governor moved up the primary date.

“We are the Michigan G.O.P.,” Mr. Hoekstra said in an interview on Friday. “Kristina Karamo is not.”

Mr. Hoekstra, a former House member who was Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the Netherlands, referred to Ms. Karamo’s gathering on March 2 as a “meeting.”

“They’re not running a convention,” he said.

Ms. Karamo, who gained notoriety for her claims of fraud in the 2020 election, was elected as the party chair last year, after losing her 2022 bid for secretary of state. She did not respond to several requests for comment on Friday, but on social media and in a recent statement from the state party’s email account, she has insisted that she is still in charge.

“The Grey Poupon Good Ole’ boys club hate that they can’t control me, and that we’ve disrupted their corruption club,” Ms. Karamo wrote on Friday on X. “Our movement isn’t going away. We are bringing a Righteous Renaissance to the Republican Party.”

Critics of Ms. Karamo said that the Michigan party had been shrouded in secrecy under her leadership and was struggling with money.

On Thursday night, Ms. Karamo sought to address her leadership status at a Republican gathering in Oakland County near Detroit. A video recorded by The Detroit News showed her being heckled as party leaders elected delegates for next month’s state convention. Some shouted that she was “out of order” and was no longer the party’s chairwoman.

The clash was playing out in the western part of the state too, where rival Republican factions in Kalamazoo County held dueling party conventions at the same time on Thursday.

Inside a community center in Scotts, Mich., a small town near Kalamazoo, a faction aligned with Ms. Karamo elected 44 delegates to send to the March 2 convention in Detroit. About 15 miles away at the 12th Street Baptist Church in Kalamazoo, the other faction elected 44 delegates to send to the convention that Mr. Hoekstra is organizing.

“It’s crazy,” Fred Krymis said in the church’s lobby.

At the Karamo-aligned event, a projector displayed a logo for the county’s Republican Party. A sign advised that outsider observers were not allowed to record the proceedings because of intraparty lawsuits. A county sheriff’s deputy was on guard, watching for violators.

In a brief interview outside the event, Rod Halcomb, the group’s chairman, described Ms. Karamo as the “legitimate” leader of the Michigan Republicans and said he believed the R.N.C.’s recognition of Mr. Hoekstra was “an incorrect decision.”

But at the other gathering, Kelly Sackett, that group’s chairwoman, said that it was time for the party to unite behind Mr. Hoekstra.

“That’s the only way we’re going to take our state back,” she said of Republicans, who do not control any statewide offices.

The division at the state level is being mirrored by the two Kalamazoo groups, which are embroiled in a series of lawsuits accusing each other of defamation and of hijacking the party’s name and likeness.

Matthew DePerno, whom Ms. Karamo defeated for party chair last year, is part of the Kalamazoo faction that has coalesced around Mr. Hoekstra. An unsuccessful candidate for state attorney general in 2022, he was charged last year in an election equipment breach in 2020, one intended to help Mr. Trump reverse his loss in Michigan.

He mused on Thursday night that the party turmoil could boil over at the Republican National Convention this summer.

“I believe there will be probably two sets of delegates sent,” he said of Michigan’s representation.

The R.N.C. did not immediately respond to requests for comment about what would happen if rival slates of Michigan delegates showed up at the convention.

Mr. Hoekstra said that he had no illusions about the party he is seeking to lead.

“I understand and I know that these divisions exist,” he said. “I am not going to let them dominate, you know, our activities and our process over the next eight months. Our job is to win elections.”","['2024', 'election', 'convention', 'ms', 'disarray', 'karamo', 'delegates', 'hoekstra', 'trump', 'mr', 'republican', 'michigan', 'gop', 'state', 'party', 'heads']",https://www.nytimes.com,0.4483524527801703
Why are shopping carts always broken?,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/17/business/shopping-carts-wonky-wheel-explained/index.html,"New York CNN —

It’s an almost-inevitable part of any shopping trip. You enter a store to grab a few necessities and find yourself pushing, pulling, lifting and/or dragging your cart up the baking aisle as the one wheel with a mind of its own squeaks and stalls against the linoleum.

A long-circulating urban myth holds that retailers deliberately make the carts unwieldy to slow your roll down the aisle, hoping to divert your attention to more merchandise. But the national frustration is not the work of a business psychology mastermind.

The notoriously combative wheels are actually created by the repeated battering that shopping carts are often subject to, explained Alex Poulos. Poulos is the sales director for R.W. Rogers, which supplies thousands of shopping carts to companies like Whole Foods, Tractor Supply Company and Meijer.

Grocery store carts are more likely to have carts with wonky wheels than other types of retailers, like clothing stores or drugstores, where the carts don’t leave the store as much; merchandifse is typically carried out in a bag or two. That’s because they are exposed to the elements much more often, and that environmental damage affects the wheels. The primary culprit, however, is often not the wheel itself, but the way it’s attached to the cart.

Over time, pulling carts through bumpy parking lots, wrestling them across the threshold of doorways in and out of the store, and forcing them up and down the curb warps the caster plate, the metal piece that attaches the wheel mechanism to the cart’s body, Poulos told CNN.

“If that caster plate gets twisted just a little, it might lift the wheel up, and then both wheels are not touching the ground at the same time,” he said.

In a perfect world where carts were handled gently and utilized only indoors, the standard five-inch polyurethane shopping cart wheel could last between six and eight years, said Alvar Diaz, vice president of Sales and Marketing at wheel and caster manufacturing company P&H Casters. In a 24/7 store environment, they’re more likely to last two or three years, while the metal casters last for about five.

But replacing the wheel without paying attention to the plate and the nuts and bolts that keep everything together means that a new wheel can be just as wobbly as an older one.

The ethics of returning shopping carts

Consumers bear some of the responsibility for the banged up and broken qualities of their shopping carts.

Carts that are abandoned outside after shoppers load their food into their vehicles are at the mercy of extreme heat, snow, ice and road salt. That prolonged exposure can damage the cart and its wheels.

To combat this, grocery retailers in Europe, such as Aldi, Tesco and Lidl, have coin locks on their carts. Customers insert a coin to “check out” a cart, which they get back when they return the cart to its original place at the end of their shopping trip.

This system, although not mainstream in the United States, makes for much longer-lasting carts and fewer wobbly wheels.

“Coin locks make sure the carts are always where they’re supposed to be,” said Poulos. “They ensure that the carts are maintained better and that (their) longevity is better because they’re not sitting in a snowbank or blown over by the wind. You also don’t need the labor to hunt them down and bring them back to the front of the store.”

Designing a better cart

One way to enhance durability is by changing the material of the wheels from the typical polyurethane to pricier rubber.

Rubber wheels have been a mainstay of motorized shopping carts for decades, said Beth Thieme, president and CEO of Amigo Mobility, which produced the first motorized cart in 1968.

A smooth and steady ride is absolutely necessary for these carts used by customers with mobility challenges. Therefore, these carts use rubber wheels with no casters or caster plates, meaning they can’t swivel or get stuck.

Retailers and manufacturers have taken note of this design. Several major chains like Walmart and Target have begun using rubber wheels in their carts.

While the rubber wheels cost twice the price of the standard polyurethane ones, Diaz said P&H Casters’ natural rubber wheels can last for about a decade, barring mistreatment from customers. In a busier store environment, they can hold out between four and five years.

However, many retailers choose cheaper parts because the upfront price is typically higher for more durable material, Poulos added. These companies end up needing to replace these parts more often as they get twisted and deformed, but these tasks — much like the carts — sometimes fall between the cracks.","['wheels', 'cart', 'poulos', 'wheel', 'retailers', 'broken', 'store', 'rubber', 'carts', 'casters', 'shopping']",https://edition.cnn.com,0.37413566766548473
